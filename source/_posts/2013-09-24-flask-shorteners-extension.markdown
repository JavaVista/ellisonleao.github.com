Hello guys, it's been a while since last post, i know, but i'm trying my
best to stay this blog updated with the all the stuff that i'm working
on these days.

Yesterday i've started to code a simple flask extension, called
Flask-Shorteners. The idea is to abstract the shortening and expading of
a given url using some famous shorteners APIs like Bit.ly and Googl
shorteners. This extension is helping me learn Flask, a really nice
web microframework for Python. If you like the extension please feel
free to contribute.

You can find the source code here:

See you next post!
