Monday is usually the day you wake a little bit more lazier, hoping to spend a little more time in bed, thinking why can't it be Friday to sleep a little more time.

Surprisingly, when I arrived at work I came across to a really fantastic notice. A notice that encouraged that Monday routine and made me think of my childhood, of how I loved to create things and how I imagine doing adult things. On that notice I saw a boy of nine years old creating an analogic arcade just using cardboard boxes. He created everything from the box that manages the money of the chips ($ 1 per card) and so-called fun passes (allowing a total of 500 shots for $ 2), to the games. The boy who helps his father in his mechanic garage, was discovered by a customer of the shop, who created a Facebook event and a Crowd Funding movementÂ  to raise money for his college. The boy's name is Caine and this short movie below was created to show all of this little boy's geniality. Check below
