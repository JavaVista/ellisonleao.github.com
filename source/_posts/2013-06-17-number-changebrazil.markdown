Hello guys,

Unfortunately this post is not about game development or web
development, but fortunately it's about a greater cause that is trying
to change the reality of many people here in Brazil. And since i live
here it's my job to share this in this blog. 

This post is to talk about a really nice video made from an initiative 
called "Change Brazil". 
This great video talks about all the bad things happening right now here in
Brazil, while the media only shows the people that we're ready to
celebrate the next World Cup and the next Olympic Games. But we are not. 
It only takes 5 minutes of your time. Please share it.
