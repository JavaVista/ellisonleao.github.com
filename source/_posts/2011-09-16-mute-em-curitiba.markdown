One of the finest things about living in Curitiba is that you can go to a lots of great shows and pay really cheap tickets. On September 4th was a hardcore day in Curitiba. I went to a show with Mute ( Canada ), one of the most promissing bands of the world hardcore bands scenario. I paid about R$ 25,00 (show worth the price) , and the show was really exciting.
